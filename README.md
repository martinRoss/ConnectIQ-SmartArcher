# ConnectIQ-SmartArcher

SmartArcher is a Garmin ConnectIQ built for archers. If worn on the string hand wrist, SmartArcher will detect when you release a shot and to what magnitude. Intended as a feedback training tool, this application shows your shot variation over time. By keeping track of your release intensities, SmartArcher shows your variation above and below your average.

Currently tested and designed forthe Garmin 935.
